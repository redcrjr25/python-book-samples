# Python Book Samples
This repository contains sample code from my learning journey with *Python for Serious Beginners*. Itâ€™s a place to test and experiment with Python concepts.

## Chapter 2
- `chapter2/P4B_ch2.py`: A simple script from section 2.4 that prints a greeting.
- `chapter2/hello_1/hello.py`: A script from section 2.4 that prints "Hello from Python for Serious Beginners!".
- `chapter2/hello_world/hello.py`: A script from section 2.5 that defines a `hello(name)` function and calls it with "joe".

## Chapter 3
- `chapter3/P4B_ch3.py`: A script from section 2.6 that prints "Hello Python the Snake!".

Explanation of the Code:

Iterative Function (concatenate_strings_iteratively):

The function initializes an empty string result.
It uses a for loop to iterate through each item in the provided list str_list.
Each item is appended to result, and a comma is added after each item except the last one.
Finally, it returns the concatenated string.
Recursive Function (concatenate_strings_recursively):

This function starts with a match statement to handle different cases:
If the list is empty ([]), it returns an empty string.
If the list contains items, it uses unpacking to separate the first item from the rest.
It checks if there are remaining items (rest). If so, it concatenates the first item with a comma followed by the result of calling the function on the rest of the items.
If there are no remaining items, it returns the first item without adding a comma.
Testing the Functions:

A sample list is defined that contains multiple lists of strings.
Each list is passed to both functions, and the results are printed to verify that both implementations yield the same result.

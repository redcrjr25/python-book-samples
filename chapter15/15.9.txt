Explanation of the Script:

Header Row:

The script begins by printing the column headers. We use end="" so that the next print will be in the same line.
A formatted string f"{i:>4}" is used to print integers from 2 to 12, formatted to right-align with a width of 4 characters.
Separator Line:

A simple line of ---- characters is printed as a separator below the header for aesthetic clarity.
Nested Loops for Multiplication:

The outer loop iterates from 2 to 12 (for rows).
For each row value, it prints a label (the current row number) followed by a pipe | for clarity.
The inner loop also iterates from 2 to 12 (for columns) and computes the product row * col.
Each product is formatted with f"{product:>4}" to ensure it's aligned properly before printing.
New Line:

After each complete row of products is printed, a print() statement ensures the next row starts on a new line.

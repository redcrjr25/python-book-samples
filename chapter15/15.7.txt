Explanation of the Code:

Function Definition:

The compare_string_length function takes two string arguments string1 and string2.
It checks the lengths of both strings using the len() function and returns:
-1 if string1 is shorter than string2.
1 if string1 is longer than string2.
0 if both strings have the same length.
Testing the Function:

We create a list called species_names containing the names of several python species, which can be used for our comparisons.
A nested loop is used to compare each pair of species names.
The results of the comparisons are printed to the console.
Output:

When this script runs, it will display a series of comparisons, outputting -1, 1, or 0 based on the lengths of the species names that are being compared.

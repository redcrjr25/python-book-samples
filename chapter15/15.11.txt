Explanation of the Code:

Importing the random Module:

We use random.choice() to randomly select the computer's choice from a list.
Function Definitions:

get_computer_choice(): Returns a random choice from the three possible options: 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors'.
get_user_choice(): Prompts the user for input, validates it to ensure it matches one of the three options, and returns the validated choice.
determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice): Compares the user’s choice and the computer’s choice to determine the winner according to the rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors. It returns a message indicating the outcome.
play_game(): The main function that runs the game. It welcomes the player, enters a loop to allow for multiple rounds, retrieves choices, determines the winner, and asks whether the player wants to play again.
Game Loop:

The game continues in a loop until the player chooses not to play again after each round.
How to Play:

Simply run the script. You will be prompted to enter your choice of rock, paper, or scissors.
The computer will randomly select its choice.
The outcome will be displayed, and you can decide to play again or exit the game.
This is a complete Rock-Paper-Scissors game implementation that allows user interaction with the computer through standard input and output.
